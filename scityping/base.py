class Serializable:
    """
    An abstract base class used to standardize the definition of
    Pydantic-serializable types, and reduce the boilerplate to do so.

    A `Serializable` subclass `SubT` must define a nested class `Data`, which
    inherits from `scityping.BaseModel` and defines the data structure used to
    serialize the class. The attribute names of the `Data` class must match the
    keywords of the class' ``__init__``.

    The nested `Data` class must also define a method `encode`, which
    takes an instance of `SubT`, extracts the attributes required for
    serializing it, and returns them as a `SubT.Data` instance.

    .. hint::
       If a `Serializable` has *the same name* (case insensitive) as one of
       its parent classes, then any instance of the *parent* class will be
       serializable. Specifically, the class' `__qualname__` attribute is
       used for this somewhat magical behaviour.

    .. rubric:: Pickle support
       Serializable objects automatically support pickling if their
       `Data.encode` method returns something that is pickleable.
       Note that this only applies to *subclasses* of `Serializable`; many of
       the provided types in this package (including `~scityping.numpy.Array`,
       `~scityping.scipy.Distribution`) *don't* return instances of themselves
       when validating values, instead returning clean, unmodified base types
       (the stated examples return `numpy.ndarray` and `scipy.stats.<rv_frozen>`
       respectively). For these types, pickling if and only if the base types
       supports it.

       Among the types defined in this package,
       `~scityping.functions.PureFunction` and its subclasses is probably the
       one which most benefits from pickling support.

        Generic custom serializer. All serialized objects follow the format
        ``(type name, serialized data)``. For example,
        ``(scityping.range, {'start': 0, 'stop': 5, 'step': none})``.
        The type name is inferred from the `value`â€™s type and is case insensitive.
        It is the key generated by `scityping.utils.TypeRegistry`.

        The class used to serialize `value` is inferred by matching the type
        of `value` to one of the entries in `cls._registry`.

        Additional positional and keyword arguments are passed on to
        ``S.Data.encode(*args, **kwargs)``, where ``S`` is the class used to
        serialize `value`. Only `kwargs` which match an argument in the signature
        of `S.Data.encode` are passed on; this allows `kwargs` to contain encoding
        arguments for different encoders, as long as all encoders use different
        argument names. (The use case for this filtering is `deep_reduce`, which
        through recursion may encode many objects but `kwargs` can only be
        specified once.)
